Dear James Smith,
We would like to invite you to our Techy Talk at Ten this Friday. 
Since this is Cybersecurity Awareness Month, all of our TTT's are 
related to ways to help keep you safe online.  This weeks's talk 
is titled 'Social Engeineering Attacks: Phishing.' Phishing attacks 
account for more than 80 percent of reported security incidents. 
Learn how to handle attacks from bad actors this Friday, at 10:10 
in Lab 243.

Stay Safe!!!
