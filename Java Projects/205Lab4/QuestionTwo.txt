a.) What exactly is the difference between the size of an Arraylist and the capacity of the
Arraylist?

The size of an array list refers to the number of elements currently stored in the list, while the
capacity refers to the total number of elements an ArrayList can hold without resizing its total array.



b.) How many elements can an Arraylist store?

After reading different sources, it appears that elements of an ArrayList vary and depends on different
factors such as the available memory on a computer or Virtual Machine. Which in theory, the number of
elements that can be stored is unlimited.


c.) Name two advantages of Arraylists over arrays.


1.) ArrayList is dynamic in size (meaning it can change it's size automatically when you add or remove elements). Hence, there is not a fixed size.

2.) You don't have to manually shift all elements down in the ArrayList when you add in between elements.



d) Name two advantages of arrays over Arraylists.


1.) It is just slightly faster to get an get and set elements. Hence, if you know the number of elements you are working with, arrays can be faster.

2.) A multidimensional structure is only available through arrays as Arraylists are only one dimensional.
